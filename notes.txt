Goal:
If code stored:
Power on, waits, sends code.
If no code stored:
program mode

If button 1 pressed, record ( rapid blink )
When same code received 3 times ( ignore repeats ),
then we stop blinking and leave record mode.

TODO: send IR codes, test, put in project box with cables/jacks and resistor/transitors driver setup.
Add some more code comments and proof read everything.
